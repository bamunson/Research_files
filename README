These are the python scripts developed/used during my research.
Below is a brief description of each one. The data is not included because of
the size limits in GitHub, but can be found in the "munson" external drives.

---Octo2Yt.py---
Developed by Sagiv Shiber and modified by Brad Munson to work in Python 3.6+
It has some dependencies, but they should all be easily available on Conda/pip.
This doesn't have to be modified much, it's just used to read Octo-Tiger Silo files.

---bradaverage.py---
Developed by Brad Munson. This is an older version of an averaging procedure to
map Octo-Tiger data into MESA. The latest version can directly read Silo files,
where this script can only read plain ASCII text files.

Here are the dependencies:
numpy : Conda standard
matplotlib : Conda standard
time : Conda standard
pandas : Conda standard
helmholtz : available on Josiah's github (https://github.com/jschwab/python-helmholtz)
scipy : Conda standard
rcbtools : available on pip and github (https://github.com/bamunson/rcbtools)

---spherical_average_bg.py---
Developed by Brad Munson. This is the newer averaging procedure. It includes some
of the same functions as the older bradaverage.py, but can read the Silo files.
This example was used for Betelgeuse, where we averaged the angular momentum and
entropy. The composition was imposed from the MESA giant model.

Dependencies:
Octo2Yt : included in this directory
numpy : Conda standard
matplotlib : Conda standard
numba : available on conda or pip
rcbtools : available on pip and github (https://github.com/bamunson/rcbtools)
helmholtz : available on Josiah's github (https://github.com/jschwab/python-helmholtz)
